# Analyzes Strava GPX files into usable graphs and data
Jake Armendariz

I got annoyed at how little data strava gives in its standard package, this will hopefully allow users to get more from their running/biking data

Allows users to know how much rest time they took, their average pace per X distance or X time

To learn more about their ride, user's would have to download GPX files from strava and then add to this library, but feel welcome to clone the repo and check it out
